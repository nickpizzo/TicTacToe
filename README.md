## Explorer Mode

Make a 2 player tic-toe-toe game.

  - [ ] The game takes turns receiving input for each player.
  - [ ] The game recognizes when a player has won.
  - [ ] The board should be updated as it's state changes when people make moves.
  - [ ] If board is full before there is a winner, declare a tie.
  - [ ] Provide feedback for invalid moves (i.e. a player attempts to move in a space that's already filled).

### Frontend: Web Interface

Create an interface using CSS and Javascript. Use jQuery to handle events (e.g. when a player clicks on the game board) and to update the board.

Don't user `alert()` or `prompt()`! Use jQuery to update the page to indicate things to the user. Input should be by the user clicking.

## Adventure Mode

  Allow a single player to choose to play against the computer's "AI".
  Your AI might just make random moves at this point, or take a stab at making
  a smarter AI

## Epic Mode

  Your AI is unbeatable. The player will always lose or at best, tie. Yes, this is totally possible. Your game should also recognize a tie as soon as it becomes impossible to win.
